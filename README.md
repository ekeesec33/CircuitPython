## LED Fade
The purpose of this assignment was to get the neopixel on the metro using the new software of Circuit Python. (You can also use this code for just making a regualr LED fade, which is what the diagram is showing below) The code for this assignment is called led.fade, and can be found above. In this assignment I learned that not everything is as easy as it looks. I also learned how to use a while True loop.

## Circuit Python Servo
The purpose of this assignment was to have the servo move one way when you touched on of the wires to a particular angle, and move the other way when you would touch the other wire depending on a certain angle. In this assignment I learned how to use a duty cycle and frequency. In short, a duty cycle determines how long a pulse stays high. Frequency is how often that pulse occurs. The code for this assignment can be found above, and is called servo.touch.control
