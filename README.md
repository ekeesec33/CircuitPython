## LED Fade
The purpose of this assignment was to get the neopixel on the metro using the new software of Circuit Python. (You can also use this code for just makign a regualr LED fade, which is what the diagram is showing below) The code for this assignment is called led.fade, and can be found above. In this assignment I learned that not everything is as easy as it looks. I also learned how to use a while True loop.
